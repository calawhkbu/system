# Documentation

1. Suggest to write the code under `swivel-backend-new/src` first (where tslint works), and then move it to `swivel-backend-custom`

2. You may need to take a look at [`node-jql`](https://github.com/kennysng/node-jql). This should help avoid some syntax errors when writing SQL

3. You can register `shortcuts` for predefined fields, and `subqueries` for extra join clauses or filters
